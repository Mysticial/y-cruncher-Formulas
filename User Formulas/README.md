# User Formulas

This is the (moderated) show-and-tell directory for formulas.

If you wish to submit a formula, please make a pull request to put it here.


**Rules for Uploading Formulas:**

1. The number being computed needs to be reasonably interesting.
2. The file needs to have an appropriate description of what it is.
3. If you didn't come up with the formula yourself, you must cite/reference the original author/discoverer.
4. The formula must not already exist in this repo - unless it is a significant modification or optimization.

If I see something that I really like, I may decide to promote it into the official list that gets distributed with y-cruncher.
Likewise, I may decide to kick things out of the official list if they become outdated and/or superficial.

**Minimum Requirements for Promotion to the Official Formula List:**
1. All the above needs to be followed.
2. The description and comments need to follow the same format as the official examples.
   - The author is the the author of the file. (not the discoverer of the algorithm)
   - The date is when the file was first made.
   - The first 50 digits after the decimal place must be included.
3. The formula itself needs to be well-formatted. No tabs allowed.
4. All the fields in the formula (`NameShort`, `NameLong`, `AlgorithmShort`, `AlgorithmLong`, etc...) need to be English readable and use only characters that have fonts on English console locales on Windows.
Use of other languages in the comment descriptions are allowed as long as they are appropriate and verifiable via a translator.
5. The formula needs to be well-optimized. No stuff like, `{Multiply : [2 3 5 7 11 ...]}`
6. The formula needs to be correct for all precisions. Approximations that are only good for a certain precision are not allowed.

I reserve the right to edit the files and formulas.
In particular, I may add notices to clarify if different formulas for the same constant are sufficiently different for compute+verify.
